        Back in the early 2000s I got my first taste of building websites using
        Expage.com. Being only 9, the first thing I build was a Pokemon website.
        Since then, I dabbled in web development until I ended up where I am
        now. I am a Full-Stack developer with determination to use technology
        for making a difference.

        These days my main focus is application development for LAZ Parking.
